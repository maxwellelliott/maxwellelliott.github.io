PhD Students
===
I am recruiting 1-2 PhD students to join my lab at the University of Minnesota in Fall 2025 (Go gophs!). My primary appointment will be in the [Clinical Science and Psychopathology Research Program (CSPR) program](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/areas-specialization/clinical-science-and-psychopathology-research-program-cspr). However I will also have a secondary appointment in the [Personality, Individual Differences, and Behavior Genetics (PIB) program](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/areas-specialization/personality-individual-differences-and-behavior-genetics-pib). So I will be able to work with students from either PhD program.

If you are interested in applying to my lab and, you have questions, please do not hesistate to reach out to me via email. See the University of Minnesota's [Department of Psychology website](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/how-apply) for application instructions.
