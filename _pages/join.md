### PhD Students

I am recruiting 1-2 PhD students to join my lab at the University of Minnesota. My primary appointment is in the [Clinical Science and Psychopathology Research Program (CSPR) program](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/areas-specialization/clinical-science-and-psychopathology-research-program-cspr). However I have a secondary appointment in the [Personality, Individual Differences, and Behavior Genetics (PIB) program](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/areas-specialization/personality-individual-differences-and-behavior-genetics-pib). So I can work with students from either PhD program, though I have higher priority to recruit students in the CSPR program.

If you are interested in applying to my lab and have questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me via email. See the University of Minnesota's [Department of Psychology website](https://cla.umn.edu/psychology/graduate/how-apply) for application instructions. 

### Postdoc

I am recruiting a postdoctoral fellow to join my lab. If you are interested, please reach out to me via email, and we can discuss further.
