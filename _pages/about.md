Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Randy Buckner's lab at Harvard University and I will be starting a lab at the University of Minnesota as a Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology in August 2025.

I am a clinical psychologist studying individual differencs in cognitive and brain aging. Age-related cognitive decline is a central public health challenge due to a rapidly aging population. However, age-related decline is not inevitable. While some older adults tragically develop dementia and disability at the cusp of retirement, others maintain exceptional cognitive functioning into their 90s. I am amazed by this variability in aging, curious to uncover its origins, and motivated by the translational need to develop better tools to measure aging. My research is driven by a central question: How can we help more people maintain cognitive functioning as they age? To help answer this question, I adopt a “go big to go small” approach. I leverage large-scale datasets to generate population-level insights into individual differences in cognitive and brain aging. In tandem, I utilize deep phenotyping of smaller, informative subpopulations to test targeted hypotheses. Throughout my work, I seek translational opportunities by identifying critical windows in the lifespan for prevention and treatment.
