Hello! I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in Randy Buckner's lab at Harvard University and I will be starting a lab at the University of Minnesota as a Assistant Professor of Clinical Psychology in August 2025.

Age-related cognitive decline is a central public health challenge due to a rapidly aging population. However, age-related decline is not inevitable. While some older adults tragically develop dementia and disability at the cusp of retirement, others maintain exceptional cognitive functioning into their 90s. I study these individual differencs in cognitive and brain aging. My research is driven by a central question: How can we help more people maintain cognitive functioning as they age? To help answer this question, I adopt a “go big to go small” approach. I leverage cohort studies (e.g. [The Dunedin Multidisciplinary Health and Development Study Health and Development Study](https://dunedinstudy.otago.ac.nz/)) and large datasets (e.g. [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) and [ADNI](https://adni.loni.usc.edu/))) to generate population-level insights into individual differences in cognitive and brain aging. In tandem, I utilize deep phenotyping of smaller, informative subpopulations to improve our ability to measure aging (e.g. [Cluster Scanning](https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00175)) and test targeted hypotheses. Throughout my work, I seek translational opportunities by identifying critical windows in the lifespan for prevention and treatment.
